# TicTacToe
Test repo for learning Git, Javascript, Node.js, and Sockets.io

Implements:
- A basic (unsecure) login system
- Game list
- Allows users to join games
- Basic UI and logic for a game of tic-tac-toe


Still TODO:
- User name/id persistence if the server goes down
- Game state persistence
- Same user logged in from multiple devices
